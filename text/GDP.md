Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of the goods and services used up in production. 

GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment. 

Real values are inflation-adjusted estimatesâ€”that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes.
