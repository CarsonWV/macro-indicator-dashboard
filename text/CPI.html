<h3>Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average</h3>
<!-- BEGIN CONVERTED MARKDOWN -->
<p>All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a measure of the average monthly change in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also represent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88 percent of the total population, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed, unemployed, retirees, and those not in the labor force.</p>
<p>The CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, and fuels; transportation fares; service fees (e.g., water and sewer service); and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas.</p>
