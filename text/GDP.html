<h3>Real Gross Domestic Product</h3>
<!-- BEGIN CONVERTED MARKDOWN -->
<p>"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of the goods and services produced by the nation&#39;s economy less the value of the goods and services used up in production."</p>
<p>"GDP is also equal to the sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic investment, net exports of goods and services, and government consumption expenditures and gross investment."</p>
<p>"Real values are inflation-adjusted estimatesâ€”that is, estimates that exclude the effects of price changes."</p>
