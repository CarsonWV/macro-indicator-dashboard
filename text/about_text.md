MacroDash is a customizable dashboard that contains live-feeds and descriptions of arbitrary macroeconomic indicators. At present, it displays the following:

* [Real Gross Domestic Product (USA)](google.com)
* [USA Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (USA)](google.com)
* [USA 10-Year Break-Even Inflation Rate (USA)](google.com)

Descriptions written and sourced by Carson Weaver. Statistics pulled from web APIs hosted by [Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/) et al. 

Website built using pure HTML and CSS. Indicators are updated daily by a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi 3B. Code is publically available on [GitHub](github.com/carsonwv/macro-indicator-dashboard) for easy download and use.
